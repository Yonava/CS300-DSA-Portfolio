# CS300-DSA-Portfolio
Portfolio to display my work in CS300: DSA - Analysis  &amp; Design

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that I solved in the project for my CS300 DSA class was how to efficiently store and retrieve class schedules for ABC University. Specifically, I used a hash table data structure to organize the schedules for students allowing for constant-time access to the information. This was important as ABC University requires the capability of scaling their services across a large student body while retaining efficiency. With a hash table, I programmed a way to quickly and easily search for and retrieve any given schedule, without having to iterate through every schedule in the system.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Part of approaching the problem of programming ABCUs systems was researching and understanding the different data structures and algorithms I could use. These approaches encompassed various options, such as dynamic arrays, binary trees, and hash tables. After evaluating each option carefully, and creating a Big 0 space/time breakdown (see Project 1 - Analysis), I chose to use a hash table for it's powerful constant-time access to information, making it very efficient for large datasets such as the class schedules for ABC University.

Through CS300, I got to learn about how different data structures have different performance characteristics, some better suited to certain tasks than others. Studying the implementations of these data structures and preforming a run time analysis on them gave me insight into how to better solve problems at scale. If the problem requires us to retrieve information quickly from a large dataset, a hash table may be the best option. On the other hand, if we need to maintain a sorted list of items, a binary tree may be a more adequate solution.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
In my CS300 DSA class, I encountered roadblocks. To overcome the obstacles, I relied on various resources including Stackoverflow, Brightspace announcements, rubrics for assignments, and professor Lings grading feedback. Additionally, when I ran into bugs or programming errors, I utilized debugging methods such as printing to the console and settings breakpoints. By using these resources and strategies, I was able to successfully overcome the roadblocks and complete the course.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on the project for my CS300 DSA class expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by deepening my understanding of data structures, improving my problem-solving skills, and helping me to develop better coding practices. This will enable me to design more robust and effective software programs in the future.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on the project for my CS300 DSA class has evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by emphasizing the importance of pseudocode and modular design.

The course focused on using pseudocode to think about problems more abstractly before coding them out. The milestone assignments helped me to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. By creating pseudocode for each milestone, I was able to better understand the problem and identify potential issues before starting the actual coding process.

In addition to the milestones, the course encouraged the use of good commenting practices to document the code in line. This helps readability and maintainability in large code bases that are more complex.
